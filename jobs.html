    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>Established in 2007, Hot Beans started out as a small company run by a few close friends in the hope to showcase our talent of website design. Now as well-known developers, Hot Beans are still providing the highest quality service as we could when we began our journey. From the beginning, we based our brand around the key ideas we would want around the center of a company.</p>
    <p>We strive to uphold these on a daily basis.</p>
